# Training supervised machine learning APT

Individual Project Machine Learning and Visualisation Assignment to develop statistical analysis and test differente machine learning algorithms:
Classification Tree, Bagging Tree, Random Forest

The implementation required to design and develop the related programs.

determineAPTactivity.R: startin by preparing and cleaning the data, then run compare the performances of different ML algorithms, and final step check the results in confusion matrix
depending on accuracy, sensitivity and specificity.

This program include dataset in .csv file and it was implemented with different programming concepts, including data types, control structures with cycles and conditional statmens
for visualisation analysis in R language
